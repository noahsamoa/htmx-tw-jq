# THQ Stack Example

## What it is:

THQ is short for (T)ailwind, (H)TMX, amd j(Q)uery

This project is a simple HTMX/jQuery test that demonstrates toggling between day and night modes using HTMX and jQuery. The project consists of two HTML files. 

## How?

- Clone and run on an http server. 
The libraries are loaded via CDN, so it's mostly static. 

## What's the point?
- jQuery4 is soon to release, so let's bring it back with modern web tools
- HTMX is fast and easy to read
- Tailwind is just Bootstrap++, meaning we have the perfect 2010 pseudostack!  
- It's ridiculously fast... really.

### Notes

- The empty tailwind.config.js is there so you VSCode cats can use your IntelliSense extension out-of-the-box.
